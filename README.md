# Chat-With-Your-PDF

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to upload multiple PDF files and ask questions about their content. Using OpenAI's language model and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the app processes PDF documents, stores them as vector embeddings, and enables interactive question-answering with natural language processing (NLP).
